Spanish world wanderer who enjoys technology, making things (cyber)secure and anything related to the sea.

I have been living and working in several countries throughout the globe initially on mobile core technologies and then, following my curiosity, moved to cybersecurity technologies grabbing on the way a pinch of the business side. If you are interested, here is my [full CV](/assests/albertolopez_cv.pdf). 

Currently I am interested in several topics from network security, secure architectures, automation on the technical side and governance, ISMS and applied security certification frameworks on the management side. Also I find interesting marketing and sales topics such as business value creation and customer-centred business strategies.

Lastly, I enjoy a lot lecturing on topics that I consider myself to have a good knowledge and I have been collaborating with the UC3M University as guest teacher and conference speaker at T3chFest.
